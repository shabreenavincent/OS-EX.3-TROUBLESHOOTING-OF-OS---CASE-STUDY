## STEP-4: Restart the System

A simple restart can often fix minor glitches and improve system performance.

## STEP-5: Check Hardware If it's a hardware-related issue, ensure that all hardware components are properly connected and functioning. Look for loose cables, overheating, or hardware failures.

## STEP-6: Run Diagnostic Tools Use built-in diagnostic tools provided by the operating system to identify hardware or software problems.

## STEP-9: Safe Mode Boot the system into safe mode to check if the problem persists. Safe mode loads the OS with minimal drivers and can help identify if third-party software is causing the issue.
